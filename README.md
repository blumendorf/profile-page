## Development Process

This profile page was created through an fully AI-assisted development process. Not a single line of code was written by hand.

### Primary Development Tools
- **Cursor IDE with Claude-3.5-Sonnet**: Handled the core development process
  - Code generation and implementation
  - Real-time code modifications and improvements
  - Technical problem-solving and debugging
  - Structure and architecture decisions

- **ChatGPT**: Content generation and refinement
  - Text content creation
  - Content review and optimization
  - Copy editing and tone consistency

### Workflow
1. Initial react app and github workflow was created with Cursor IDE
2. Initial concepts and requirements were created with ChatGPT by reviewing existing CVs and profiles
3. Claude was instructed to include tailwind css and lucide icons
4. Claude implemented the content into code, handling:
   - HTML structure
   - CSS styling
   - JavaScript functionality
5. Iterative improvements were made through continuous AI collaboration
6. Final review and testing were performed to ensure quality

This project demonstrates the potential of human-AI collaboration in web development, where AI tools handle both the technical implementation and content creation aspects while human oversight guides the overall direction and final decisions.
